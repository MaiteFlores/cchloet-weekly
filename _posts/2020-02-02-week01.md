**Why Open Source**

Before starting the first day of classes, I had no idea what this course (_Open Source Software Development_) would be about or involve doing. So I _really_ just signed up for this class blindly. What I **did** know was that out of the handful of elective courses in the computer science department, this was one of the more interesting named classes. You might think "_Okay if the name sounded interesting, what *did* you think the class was about?_". First of all, thank you for asking. In short I thought the class would be working with open source projects to develop a complete product by the end of the semester. I am excited to see how close I am to my assumption.
