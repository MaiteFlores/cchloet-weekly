  - I understand how to use git's features of pulling, merging, forking, etc.
  - A willingness to try and understand other's work
  
- Some things that I find the most interesting are:
  - Cooking
  - Binge watching netflix
  - Sleeping
  - Reading about new developments in the scientific/medical community
  

#### My Contributions to FOSS  
This week, I took an uber home late at night, and of course the driver struck up a conversation with me. At first it began with small talk, but after we both divulged information about ourselves, I discovered the driver had recently began to learn how to code. *On top of that*, he was also in the midst of developing an app. Once I found out he was working on the app by himself, I wanted to convince him to consider making the app a FOSS project. Even though he was against the idea, I still wanted to show him how beneficial it would be to develop some FOSS projects with others to expand his knowledge.  
So in short, I "*peer pressure*" a driver to begin working on FOSS projects.
