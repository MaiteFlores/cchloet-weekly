My name is Christina and I am _obviously_ a computer science major, although if you were to look at some of the code I write
many would beg to differ. I also do a minor in Japanese language, but if you actually translate what I say I admittedly sound pretty
child like. Other than school I spend my time working in a restaurant on any off days I can find. But eventually I do hope to steer my work away from the restaurant industry (where I've spent the **majority** of my _working career_) and focus strictly on a coding heavy career. I'm not quite sure what else to include about myself, so for now I'll leave it here. Thank you for reading!

### More Information

I am capable in coding in languages including:
 * C++
 * Python
 * HTML
 * CSS

Although I do hope to include:
 * The Arduino language
 * Java
 * Javascript
in the near future of languages i can utilize.

Full disclosure, I feel the absolute **most** comfortable coding in strictly C++.
